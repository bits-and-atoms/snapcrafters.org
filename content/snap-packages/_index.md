# Snapcrafters dashboard

<p class="u-no-max-width">
This page shows the status of <a href="https://snapcraft.io/publisher/snapcrafters">all our snap packages</a>. The goal of this page is to give snapcrafters and community members a clear overview of what work still needs to be done. Take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/snapcrafters/.github/wiki/Contributing">contributing guide</a> for more information on how to contribute.

<p class="u-no-max-width">
An easy way to start contributing is to test snaps and review <a href="https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+org%3Asnapcrafters">open pull requests</a> and <a href="https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+org%3Asnapcrafters+label%3Atesting">open calls for testing</a>.
