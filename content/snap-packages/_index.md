# Snapcrafters dashboard

This page shows the status of [all our snap packages](https://snapcraft.io/publisher/snapcrafters). It's updated every 15 minutes using [releasegen](https://github.com/jnsgruk/releasegen).

The goal of this page is to give snapcrafters and community members a clear overview of what work still needs to be done. Take a look at our [contributing guide](https://github.com/snapcrafters/.github/wiki/Contributing) for more information on how to contribute.

An easy way to start contributing is to test snaps and review pull requests.
