# Welcome to the Snapcrafters community

We are a group of volunteers who maintain snap packages for third-party software. We publish more than [70 snaps](https://snapcraft.io/publisher/snapcrafters) used by 1.5 million weekly active devices across 50+ distributions. Our goal is to be a trusted and reliable source for high-quality snaps.

We're passionate about making the Linux desktop app ecosystem easier, more robust and more secure.
